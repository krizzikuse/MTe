# MTe - Mercury Trade enhanced
an enhanced version of Mercury Trade now featuring Price-Verification, as seen in other Path of Exile Trading Tools!

Uses Live-Data (Live at the selection of the League in Notification Settings) from poe.ninja for currency conversion
  league can now be configured in Notification settings!
  
Enhanced Icon handling -> icons are displayed much more frequently than in the original Mercury Trade.

A new configurable hotkey for toggling notifications visibility.

The bug known from the original Mercury Trade where Notifications disappeared and new trade whispers were not being registered anymore (no sound, no new notification popping up) is most likely fixed - see the release notes for details.

**for anyone wondering:
I accidently deleted the old README.MD using git-push...**

**In case you want to hit me up and talk about MTe ingame - bugs, your opinion, whatever - my character name at the moment is "ÓchiPólemosExóntosi"**

## HOW TO INSTALL:
---

Download and install Java on your computer, then open MTe.jar. Because the program operates on top of a Path of Exile window as an overlay, **make sure your client is not in fullscreen mode**.

**IMPORTANT: the Enhancements_Config folder needs to stay at the same hierarchy level as MTe.jar, just like in the provided 7z-archive, otherwise it will not work as it contains needed config-files, as well as currency-related data (exchange-rates, terms, etc.) !**

**You can place the provided shortcuts at your taskbar and start it using one of them.
All you need to do for them to work is correct the path, so it matches the path to MTe.jar on your computer!**
Although you'll probably don't need the *_debug shortcut - as this one is for debugging purposes on my own computer (provides a port i can attach to with netbeans).

**DON'T FORGET TO UPDATE your AccountName in Settings, as well as the League you're playing in, ptherwise the price-check/price-verification won't work!**

Upon launch you'll be greeted with a short overview of the application (identical to this ReadMe) and patch notes. Afterwards you should see **Task Panel** and **Notification Panel**.
